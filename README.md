## BackBoard

**BackBoard** For testing stock trading strategies because we’re curious if any of them work. We’re starting with William O’Neil’s CANSLIM strategy—but we’ll move on to others soon enough. It’s like a blackboard for sketchy backtests not yet worthy of ink, and like a basketball backboard off which strategies will either bounce or sink.

This README is a log of progress for now. Proper documentation may happen eventually, though I wouldn’t hold my breath.
