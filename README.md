# CANSLIM Trading Strategy Project

This project implements the CANSLIM equities trading strategy, as described by William J. O'Neil in *How to Make Money in Stocks*. 

The goal is to build a Python-based system for both backtesting and live trading using the CANSLIM methodology.

## Status

I'm just getting started. Licensing information and documentation to follow.

> *Disclaimer: O'Neil and his book aren't my favorite. I'm not a fan of the snake-oil-selling tone and patriotic theme.  Still, implementing and testing his trading strategy is a sound project.
