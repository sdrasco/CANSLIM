## BackBoard

**BackBoard** For testing stock trading strategies because we’re doubtful any of them work. It’s like a blackboard for sketchy backtests not yet worthy of ink, and like a basketball backboard off which strategies will either bounce or sink, adding to the ever-growing tally of doubt. 

We’re starting with William O’Neil’s CANSLIM strategy.  He seemed ripe for confirming our doubts.  We’ll move on to others soon enough. This space is a log of progress for now. Proper documentation may happen eventually, though I wouldn’t hold my breath.
