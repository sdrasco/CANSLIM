## BackBoard

**BackBoard** is a tool for testing stock trading strategies because we’re curious if any of them work. We’re starting with William O’Neil’s CANSLIM strategy—don’t ask why—but we’ll move on to others soon enough. It’s like a blackboard for sketchy backtests not yet worthy of ink, and like a basketball backboard off which strategies will either bounce or sink.

## Project Progress

- **Setup Complete**: Project structure ready, data fetching implemented for market aggregates and financials.
- **Aggregates Data**: Processing the top 1000 tickers by average daily volume across historical data.
- **Financials Data**: Streamlined fetching and integration of financial statements for the selected tickers.
- **Next Steps**: Begin backtesting strategies, starting with O’Neil’s and adding more as we go.
