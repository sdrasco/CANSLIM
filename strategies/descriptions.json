  "Market Only (SPY)": {
    "description": "This strategy invests entirely in the SPY ETF, which tracks the S&P 500 index. It never rotates out of the market and serves as a baseline for comparison."
  },
  "Risk Managed Market (BIL-SPY)": {
    "description": "This strategy uses a simple market condition indicator (M, borrowed from the CANSLIM strategy) to decide when to be invested in the market (SPY) or in a money market proxy (BIL) for capital preservation. When the market is in an uptrend, it stays fully invested in SPY; otherwise, it moves to BIL. Rebalancing is performed quarterly."
